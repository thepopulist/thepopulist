                    WALKING on my daily commute in East London, I see communist posters littering the
                    streets, about everything from culture under capitalism to labour strikes and LGBTQ+
                    rights. While I have some sympathy for them and smile at the campaigners handing out
                    socialist newspapers outside the hospital, I can't help but think this is a sign of
                    something bigger than a "leftist resurgence".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem is, trying to convince people of other economic systems other than
                    capitalism while living under it is almost like trying to convince fish of a life outside of
                    the ocean. Our children are often taught that humans are either inherently selfish or
                    "irrational", and that the profit motive is the only way to convince people to do good
                    things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every piece of media and education a Western child is exposed to is produced under
                    capitalism, which is neither surprising nor particularly upsetting – after all, most of the
                    past is a long line of people who knew nothing different. This begs the question, where
                    in the world really deviates from the capitalist status quo? There may be regimes like
                    North Korea or China which claim to be anti-capitalist, but are really just authoritarian
                    dictatorships or Techno-Feudalist states respectively.
                </p>

                    Maybe some countries are achieving growth and improving living standards, but
                    simultaneously, first-world countries like the UK are seeing drastic wage stagnation,
                    rising wealth inequality<sup
                        data-reference="Machin, S. (2024, July). Real wages, inequality and living standards. Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics.">1</sup>
                    and a decline in living standards and
                    life
                    satisfaction<sup
                        data-reference="Measuring progress, well-being and beyond GDP in the UK: August 2024. (2024, August 8). Office for National Statistics.">2</sup>.
                    This leads
                    me to believe that modern capitalism, even when mediated by a government that claims
                    to be both fiscally and socially progressive, is not going too well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenging capitalism, however, is a difficult task, especially with its somewhat global
                    economic consensus and the last three hundred years of true progress under its shadow.
                    In many eyes, to challenge capitalism is to endorse communism – an absurd statement,
                    but a popular belief nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although capitalism as an established idea is only about 300 years old, people can't really
                    formulate an idea of what life was like before its hegemony – apart from the fact that it
                    must have been terrible. The truth is, complex societies have existed since crop irrigation
                    over 8,000 years ago, and we've been trying to find ways of governing these societies ever
                    since. Neoliberal capitalism is just the latest in a series of experiments with this abstract
                    idea of an economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're a political philosophy nerd like me, you might be thinking about the "Third
                    Way". The Third Way is an idea whereby neoliberal economic theory is included for its
                    promise of perfect supply and demand and infinite economic growth, but social
                    democratic welfare is provided to try and mitigate its harmful effects. Almost like giving
                    a raging bull a speedball and then employing an unpaid intern to run around the china
                    shop and inject it with ketamine to calm it down in some kind of sadistic rodeo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neoliberalism rests on the belief that prioritising economic growth above all else will
                    ultimately benefit everyone – by cutting taxes for the top 1%, their extra wealth is
                    supposed to "trickle down" to the rest of society through higher tax revenues, increased
                    spending, and new investments that fuel further expansion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is total and utter bullshit. Regardless of where you look, whenever these policies
                    have been employed, wealth inequality has increased. When the rich get more wealth,
                    they start to accrue passive income from their property – house prices go up, and when
                    you own 10 houses<sup
                        data-reference="Also, if you own 10 houses there’s 9 other poor bastards wondering why they can’t get one.">3</sup>
                    it begins to add up. As the aim of capitalism is to accrue wealth,
                    the
                    rich then spend as little of that money as possible, and their assets continue to increase
                    in value at your expense, providing them with an income with no labour. This process
                    just keeps ordinary people below the elites in the economic food chain.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It doesn't matter how much money the government tries to throw at the problem
                    through welfare: the poor are employed by the rich, and as soon as the money from their
                    labour gets to the rich, it simply stays there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why Liz Truss only got 44 days. The deregulation and tax cuts not only spooked
                    the markets and crashed the pound, but they also would have had devastating effects on
                    the working and middle classes if introduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, isn't it about time we find something different? I'm really tired of people trying to
                    convince others that all they need to do is work a little bit harder to be able to survive –
                    but I'm also cross at the naivety of Marxists in believing that a centrally planned
                    economy will ever be able to address the needs of the people in a considerate way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we want to create something new, we have to look at how we've survived for so long.
                    The human race's greatest asset is our mental flexibility, which is currently being held
                    back by unwieldy and oversized institutions hell-bent on upholding a harmful status
                    quo long past its sell-by date. If we want to continue to survive, we must prove our
                    agility and our ability to change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point is, we're not going to improve anything if we keep waiting for things to get
                    better. We won't be saved by growth or productivity as long as they benefit the elites
                    above all else.
