                    The Populist is a digital political magazine intended to reclaim populism from
                    self-serving billionaires and restore political power to the British people, breaking the attention
                    monopoly held by the Media.

                <p class="about_text">
                    Legacy media is corrupt and in the hands of a few elite families, while social media companies are
                    owned
                    by the most wealthy despite an attempted illusion of free speech benevolence. Due to this, there is
                    no
                    way to publicly discuss topics that go against the interests of these groups. Hereâ€™s where we come
                    in.

                    <br>
                    The Populist is unlike any other political magazine or newspaper. Its guidelines and review process
                    are
                    completely transparent to enforce accountability, and a wide variety of voices will be included in
                    the
                    conversation to avoid echo chambers. We will not shy away from radical thinking, as radical
                    solutions
                    are required to solve the problems we face.
